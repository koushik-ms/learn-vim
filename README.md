# Learn VIM

This is the project folder to learn VIM. All the files here are created to tryout and learn the different features of VIM.

Initially these are the features I am trying to learn:

1. Porgrammer features, like moving in units of blocks (functions, statements etc).
2. selecting and copy-pasting stuff. deleting blocks (paragraphs, functions, statements etc)
3. Tabs & editing multiple files. See [Tabs](Tabs.md)
4. Mutliple windows in one session, splitting screen into windows and editing same/ different file in each.
5. code refactoring.
6. compilation and building with VIM.

Notes:
1. `asciinema` to record terminal sessions. WoW!
